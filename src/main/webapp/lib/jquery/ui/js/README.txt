The jQuery autocomplete JavaScript file included here are not part of the released UI library yet.
They were taken from jQuery's SVN repository:
    http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/autocomplete
r3618

When the autocomplete widget is formally included in jQuery UI (likely v1.8) and the Fluid Infusion
library is upgraded to use that version of jQuery UI, we should upgrade CollectionSpace to that
version of Infusion and remove this copy of the autocomplete widget.
